    "# Multiclass classification\n",
    "\n",
    "When solving a classification problem, many existing machine learning models allow only two classes to be separated, usually referred to as \"positive\" and \"negative\". Positive patterns are commonly those related to what is to be detected, such as disease, alarm, or a type of object in an image. Negative patterns are often characterised by the absence of this characteristic that positive patterns have. To develop an ANN that classifies into two classes, a single neuron is needed in the output layer, with a logarithmic (or similar) sigmoidal transfer function, such that the output of the ANN will be between 0 and 1, and can be interpreted as the ANN's certainty in classifying a pattern as \"positive\". The classification into \"negative\" or \"positive\" is done in a simple way, by applying a threshold which is typically 0.5, although this can be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are many occasions when a system that is able to classify into more than two classes is desired. A simple example is a system that wants to classify an image according to whether a dog, cat or mouse, or some other type of animal is observed. In this case, you want to develop a 4-class classification system: \"dog\"/\"cat\"/\"mouse\"/\"other\". If an ANN to distinguish between these 3 animals is required, an output neuron for each class is needed, including the \"other\" class (4 output neurons in total).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the multiclass classification scheme, as has been done in previous assignments, an encoding called one-hot-encoding is generally used, which is based on obtaining a boolean value for each pattern and each class, in such a way that each boolean value will be equal to 1 if that pattern belongs to that class, and 0 otherwise. When training an ANN with this scheme, each output neuron can be understood as a model specialised in classifying in a given class. In this type of networks, a linear transfer function is usually used in the output layer, whereby negative outputs indicate that a neuron does not classify the pattern into that class (i.e. from the point of view of that class it classifies it as \"negative\"), and positive outputs indicate that a neuron classifies the pattern as that class (i.e. from the point of view of that class it classifies it as \"positive\"). The absolute value of a neuron's output indicates that neuron's confidence in the classification. Finally, the softmax function receives these classification values and transforms them in such a way that they are between 0 and 1, and add up to 1, interpreted as the probability of belonging to each class. The pattern will be classified into the class whose output value is the highest. The softmax function is defined as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "softmax(y^i) = \\frac{e^{y^i}}{\\sum_j{e^{y^j}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y^i$ is the output of the $i$-th neuron. For example, in a 3-class classification problem, if the outputs from the 3 neurons are `[2, 1, 0.2]`, they would classify the inputs as belonging to their respective classes, although the first one with much greater certainty. After applying the softmax function, the respective probabilities will be `[0.65, 0.24, 0.11]`, so the pattern will be classified as the first class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, the softmax function converts the real values produced by the output neurons into probability values, so that the more negative a value is (the more certainty of not belonging to that class), the closer it is to 0, and the more positive a value is (the more certainty of belonging to that class), the closer it is to 1. As indicated above, the sum of output probabilities will be equal to 1. Because of this fact, a fourth special class \"other\" is needed in the example above and in any other example where a pattern may not belong to any of the predefined classes.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Why is this extra class necessary when using the softmax function?"

    "\n",
    "`The next chunk of code simulates the output of an ANN with softmax like activation function. This case represents an output in which negative values suggest that the ANN is not sure about classifying the input as belonging to any of the classes. However, after aplying the softmax function to is values, we obtain a confident prediction, that is not desirable. By adding an extra class defined as other and showing to the model examples of this types of data, if the ANN is not sure about the output class, the model should return a more confident value to the other class `\n"

    "Therefore, the \"positive\"/\"negative\" scheme no longer applies if more than two classes are required. The problem in these cases is that many of the machine learning models are only capable of separating two classes, so theoretically they could not be used. An example of such systems are Support Vector Machines (SVM), which are discussed in more detail in the theory class. Modifications have been made to the formulation of this model to allow multi-class classifications; however, in practice they are not commonly used, and instead a strategy that allows binary SVMs to be used to classify into multiple classes is often employed.\n",

Three classifiers would therefore be trained with the same inputs but with different desired outputs for each problem.\n",

    "Finally, it is necessary to consider a different scenario when assigning patterns to classes. So far, and in most situations, the classes considered are mutually exclusive, i.e. in the example above, an animal is either a dog, a cat, a mouse, or none of the 3, but it cannot be of several classes at the same time. This is the most common case, but occasionally a problem will have classes that are not mutually exclusive. For example, when classifying animal sounds according to the animal that makes them, it may happen that several animals are mixed in one sound. In these cases, the use of a linear transfer function in the last layer together with the softmax function would not work, since, naturally, the sum of the probabilities of belonging to the classes may be greater than 1 (it may belong to several classes at the same time). For these cases, the scheme that can be used to train ANNs is to use logarithmic sigmoidal transfer functions in the last layer (instead of linear), which give an output between 0 and 1, and not to perform transformation using the softmax function. In this way, the final output of each output neuron is independent of the rest of the output neurons, and more than one can take values close to 1. The output of each neuron would again be interpreted as the probability of belonging to that class, but in this case the sum of the probabilities does not have to be 1 (they are independent). Not applying the softmax function has two advantages: the first, already mentioned, is that it allows classification into non-mutually exclusive classes; the second is that an additional class (\"other\" in the example above) is no longer needed for cases where a set of inputs may not belong to any of the given classes.\n",

    "In the case of using a \"one-against-all\" strategy, this would be similar to the last row, except that the interval would not necessarily be `[0, 1]`, but would be conditioned by the model used, and therefore the threshold as well. For example, the outputs of a SVM range from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$, so the typical threshold is set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another factor to consider when dealing with multiclass problems is the performance metric. Most of the metrics studied (PPV, sensitivity, etc.) correspond to binary classification problems. When the number of classes is greater than 2, these metrics can still be used; however, their use is slightly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the number of classes is greater than two, the PPV, NPV, sensitivity and specificity metrics can be calculated separately for each class. Thus, from the point of view of a particular class, that class will be referred to as the positive class and the rest of classes will be put together in the negative class. In this way, from the exclusive point of view of that class, TP, TN, FP and FN can be calculated, and from them the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV values for that particular class, and finally the F-score value. This way of treating classes separately is similar to the development of several classifiers in the \"one-against-all\" strategy (in the case of training binary classifiers that do not allow multi-class classification). Once these values have been calculated, they can be combined into a single value that will be used to evaluate the performance of the classifier. In this regard, there are 3 strategies: macro, weighted, and micro. We will use only the first two:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Macro**. In this strategy, those metrics such as the PPV or the F-score are calculated as the arithmetic mean of the metrics of each class. As it is an arithmetic average, it does not consider the possible imbalance between classes.\n",
    "- **Weighted**. In this stratey, the metrics corresponding to each class are averaged, weighting them with the number of patterns that belong (desired output) to each class. It is therefore suitable when classes are unbalanced.\n",
    "- **Micro**. TP, FN, and FP are calculated globally. When the classes are not mutually exclusive, the micro-PPV or micro-F-score is equal to the accuracy value. Therefore, this metric is useful when there are mutually exclusive classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are asked to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Develop the code necessary to perform a \"one-against-all\" strategy. Although it is not necessary to develop it for multiclass classification with ANNs, it will be used in future assignments. A simple way of doing it is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Calculate the number of classes and create a 2-dimensional matrix of real values, with as many rows as patterns and as many columns as classes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```Julia\n",
    "    outputs = Array{Float32,2}(undef, numInstances, numClasses);\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Make a loop that iterates over each class. Inside this loop, the desired outputs corresponding to that class are created and the corresponding model is trained with those inputs and the new desired outputs corresponding to that class. In other words, a model is created for each class that indicates whether or not the pattern belongs to that class. Subsequently, this model is applied to the inputs (training and/or test) to calculate the outputs, which will be copied into the previously created matrix. The code would be similar to the following, in which a supposed fit function has been used to train a binary classification model:\n",
    "    \n",

    "    for numClass in 1:numClasses\n",
    "        model = fit(inputs, targets[:,[numClass]]); outputs[:,numClass] .= model(inputs);\n",
    "    end;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### Question\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this code it has also been assumed that `targets` is of type `AbstractArray{Bool,2}`. How could this be done if it were a vector with classes of any type (e.g. containing [\"car\", 17, \"motorbike\"]), i.e. of type Array{Any,1}?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    `To handle targets as an array of any type (Array{Any,1}), the process would involve encoding the classes into a binary matrix where each row represents whether a pattern belongs to a given class or not. This can be done using one-hot encoding.`\n",
    "    <br/>\n",
    "    \n",
    "     - Once the outputs are in the `outputs` matrix, the highest value is taken for each row (each pattern), i.e. the class of the model that has the highest certainty that it belongs to \"its\" class is taken.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - Optionally, the softmax function can be passed. The end result is the same: the class with the highest value will be taken. However, the softmax function allows you to interpret the outputs as the probability of belonging to each class. One problem in using softmax is that it is prepared for use with ANNs, so it expects each pattern to be in a row. To solve this, you would have to transpose the outputs matrix and transpose the result back, as follows:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        ```Julia\n",
    "        outputs = softmax(outputs')';\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        \n",
    "     - To take the highest output for each class, it can be done in a similar way as in practice 2 the accuracy was calculated in the case of having more than 2 classes and the patterns arranged in a row. The code could be similar to the following:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     ```Julia\n",
    "     vmax = maximum(outputs, dims=2);\n",
    "     outputs = (outputs .== vmax);\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     In this way, a matrix of Boolean outputs is generated with the class to which each pattern belongs, which can be used to compare with the target matrix to calculate the different performance metrics.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     ### Question\n",
    "     \n",
    "     The last piece of code may present problems in case several models generate the same output. Where would the problem be, and how would it could be solved?"

    "    - Aggregate the values of sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and F-score for eachclass into a single value according to the *macro* or *weighed* strategy, as specified in the input argument.\n",
